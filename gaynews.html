        UEFI Secure Boot Vulnerability (CVE-2024-7344)
A vulnerability (CVE-2024-7344, CVSS 6.7) was discovered in UEFI systems, allowing attackers to bypass Secure Boot protections and execute unsigned code during system startup. This issue has since been patched.
<br>
<br>
Key Details:
Cause: The flaw originated from certain UEFI applications using a custom PE loader instead of secure UEFI functions like LoadImage and StartImage. This allowed malicious binaries to be loaded from a specially crafted file (cloak.dat), bypassing Secure Boot, even if it was enabled.
<br>
<br>
Impact: Successful exploitation permitted attackers to:
<br>
<br>
Deploy malicious UEFI bootkits.
Gain persistent and covert access, surviving reboots and OS reinstalls.
Evade detection by OS-based security tools, including EDR solutions.
Affected Products: Several recovery software suites were vulnerable, including:
<br>
<br>
Howyar SysReturn (before 10.2.023_20240919)
Greenware GreenGuard (before 10.2.023-20240927)
Radix SmartRecovery (before 11.2.023-20240927)
Sanfong EZ-back System (before 10.3.024-20241127)
WASAY eRecoveryRX (before 8.4.022-20241127)
CES NeoImpact (before 10.1.024-20241127)
SignalComputer HDD King (before 10.3.021-20241127).
Exploitation:
Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by:
<br>
<br>
Using the affected UEFI binaries (reloader.efi) with Microsoft’s third-party UEFI certificate.
Deploying the malicious files to the EFI partition, which required elevated privileges (administrator on Windows, root on Linux).
Mitigation Steps:
Patches Applied: Vulnerable products were updated, and Microsoft revoked unsafe binaries as part of the January 14, 2025 Patch Tuesday update.
Additional Protections:
Regular UEFI revocation management.
Restrict access to the EFI partition.
Customize Secure Boot configurations.
Implement remote attestation with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
Concerns and Insights:
ESET researchers noted that:
<br>
<br>
The discovery of insecure, signed UEFI binaries raises concerns about vendor practices and the prevalence of similar flaws.
The timeliness of fixes was commendable, but it highlights that Secure Boot alone isn’t an impenetrable defense.
