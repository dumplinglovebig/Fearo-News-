        NTLMv1 Group Policy Bypass Found
Researchers discovered that NTLMv1, a legacy Windows authentication protocol, can bypass Active Directory Group Policy due to misconfigurations in on-premises applications.
<br>
<br>
Key Points:
NTLMv1 Deprecated: Officially removed in Windows 11 (24H2) and Server 2025.
Bypass Mechanism: Misconfigured Netlogon Remote Protocol settings can override Group Policy meant to block NTLMv1.
Impact: Allows attackers to exploit NTLMv1 vulnerabilities despite policy protections.
Mitigation: Enable NTLM audit logs, identify vulnerable apps, and ensure systems are up-to-date.

NTLMv1 Group Policy Bypass Revealed
Researchers have identified a way to bypass Microsoft's Group Policy designed to disable NTLMv1 authentication, exposing organizations to potential attacks through misconfigured on-premises applications.
<br>
<br>
NTLMv1 Deprecated: Although officially removed in Windows 11 (24H2) and Server 2025, NTLMv1 remains exploitable due to legacy support and misconfigurations.
The Bypass: A setting in the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC) allows NTLMv1 authentication through the NETLOGON_LOGON_IDENTITY_INFO structure, overriding Group Policy settings.
Attacker Advantage: This flaw enables threat actors to exploit NTLMv1 vulnerabilities, such as relaying authentication information to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions on behalf of victims.
Recommendations:
Enable audit logs for all NTLM authentication in the domain.
Regularly review applications to identify those misconfigured to allow NTLMv1.
Keep systems up-to-date and apply stricter authentication protocols like NTLMv2 or Kerberos.
